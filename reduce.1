.SH NAME
reduce \- clean and filter a multiple sequence alignment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B reduce \fB[\fP\fB-sv\fP\fB][\fB\-a \fI\sacred_file\fR ] in.msa in_distance_matrix.hat2 out.msa n_to_keep
.SH DESCRIPTION
We have a huge multiple sequence alignment that is too big for building a good tree. This program will read the distance matrix from mafft, visit pairs of sequences that are most similar and remove one member of each pair. If there are sequences which are especially interesting, you can declare them to be sacred. If they appear within a pair, they will not be removed.
.PP
From each pair, we can also choose the strategy for removing members. By default, we keep the first sequence from every pair, but this can be changed with the
.B \-c
option.
.PP
The program keeps removing sequences until there are no more than
.I n_to_keep
left.
.PP
Be default, completely empty columns will be removed (see
.BR \-f " flag".
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 7
\fB-a\fP \fIfilename\fP
\fIfilename\fP is a list of sequences which are sacred and should not be deleted. Sequences should be listed one per line. They should appear exactly as in the
.I in.msa
file, with the comment character like this
.nf
> AAX51857.1 putative profilin [Toxoplasma gondii]
> NP_001015592.1 profilin-1 [Bos taurus]
.fi

.TP 7
.BI \-c " method"
From pairs of sequences, we have to pick which to delete. This is done according to
. Which can be one of
.RS
.IP first 14
From each pair, choose the first.
.IP second 14
From each pair, choose the second.
.IP random 14
From each pair, choose one pseudo-randomly.
.RE
.TP 7
.BI \-e " seed"
If using the random choice method for picking sequences to keep, set the random seed with this option. If you do not do so, there will be a default value so you will get reproducibility from run to run.
.TP
.B \-f
If you want, you can keep completely empty columns in an alignment. It is hard to see why this would be useful except for debugging.
.TP
.B \-g
Remove gaps from sequences when they are written out. Use this option if you want to re-align the sequences after reducing the set.
.TP
.B \-i
Do not check the length of sequences as they are read up. Ignore the sequence length. This is for the unlikely case that you have distances, presumably calculated by a multiple sequence alignment, but you want to do the reduction on a file of unaligned sequences.
.br
This option is not compatible with the
.B  \-f
option.
.TP
.BI \-p " plotfilename"
Every time, before a sequence is removed, print out the number of sequences remaining and the corresponding distance from the distance matrix. You can then plot them. In a program like gnuplot, you might say,
.in +4n
.EX
plot 'plotfilename' using 1:2
.EE
.in
but you probably want to reverse the xrange, so it goes from biggest to smallest.
.TP 7
\fB-s\fP
Sequences containing "seed" will be removed. Mafft uses these as constraints on the alignment. They usually come from structural alignments.
.TP 7
\fB-v\fP
Be more verbose. Multiple options increase verbosity.
.SH NOTES
We use mafft for multiple sequence alignments, so we start by reading their formats.
The biggest issue is the ordering of sequences.
Mafft writes the distance matrix in the same order as its input sequences. It may then reorder the sequences when it writes the alignment, which is what we read. This means that the order in the distance matrix file may not correspond to the order in the alignment.

This is not fatal. It means we have to parse the names written by mafft at the start and use these as lookups.
.SS Threads
There are a few threads here. Input files are read concurrently. This is a good idea. The first time sequences are read, they are gobbled up and put in a queue where they are processed, gaps counted and put into a map object. This was fun, but may not save much time.
.SS Storage
Sequences are read up and indexed by their comment field in a map structure. This was not such a good idea. It might have been better to use a simple array and helper arrays to allow us to handle files with re-ordered sequences.

.SH EXAMPLES
You have calculated an alignment and put it in
.IR "aligned_seqs.fa" .
You do not care which sequences are kept within each pair, but you have two sequences which must be kept and you want to see them in later work. In a text editor, you make a file called
.I sacred_seqs
and it has a few lines like
.nf
> AAX51857.1 putative profilin [Toxoplasma gondii]
> NP_001015592.1 profilin-1 [Bos taurus]
.fi
From an alignment with
.I mafft
, you have a distance matrix file with a name like
.IR "aligned_seq.fa.hat2" .
run
.in +4n
.EX
reduce -a sacred_seqs aligned_seqs.fa aligned_seqs.fa.hat2 reduced_seqs.fa 1000
.EE
.in
and you will get 1000 sequences in
.IR reduced_seqs.fa .

Now, imagine you do not know how many sequences you should keep. You see how the size of matrix entries goes up as you remove sequences. Then you might say
.in +4n
.EX
reduce -p distplot.dat aligned_seqs.fa aligned_seqs.fa.hat2 /dev/null 1
.EE
.in
You will get a file for plotting in \fIdistplot.dat\fR, and you will not get any sequences written out (no reduced set), because the output is put in /dev/null.
.SH BUGS
.IP * 
To get items off the queue, we do a
.nf
  front()
  pop()
.fi
They are combined into front_and_pop(), but there is some unnecessary copying.

.IP *
If a program like jalview is allowed to work with the sequences, he may well take a line like
.br
.nf
> abcde
.fi
and rewrite it like
.br
.nf
>abcde
.fi
This code will expect the space in the sequence file and complain about a mismatch with the distance file. Workaround: Do not store full comments. Store stuff after the leading ">" and after discarding white space. This may break other programs that expect the ">" to be present.

.IP *
There should be another option for choosing the member of each pair to be kept. We should offer to pickt the longer or shorter. The choice is not obvious. Often the longer just has rubbish such as unrecognised introns, so we want the shorter. Unfortunately, the shorter might be a partial sequence.
